This program is a very simple and basic Java project that serves as a management system 
for employees, cars, and people with bank accounts. 
All information is stored in an ArrayList without using a database. 

People who own a specific card (e.g., Visa) are registered in the system 
and can purchase a car. Each car includes basic details such as description, price, 
purchase number, and an invoice. The technical specifications are intentionally simplified, 
as the goal was learning, not building a perfect project.

Employees can view their personal information within the company as well as their monthly salary. 
They can also calculate their net salary after taxes, based on information such as 
marital status and number of children. They can modify some of their personal data, 
but not all (e.g., the national ID number cannot be changed). 

Each employee can send a quick request to the company to report urgent matters 
such as illness or inability to come to work. 

There is also a "secret" administrator access. 
If the correct password is entered, the administrator can make any changes 
in the system, such as deleting employees or cars, 
or editing their information.

The sole purpose of this program is to be able to see my progress in the future. 
It is not a professional or complex application, but only for practice and learning.
